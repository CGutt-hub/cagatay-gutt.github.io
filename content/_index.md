## Research Philosophy

My research is driven by a fascination with **consciousness**—both biological and artificial—and a firm commitment to **open and transparent science**. I believe the most profound advancements in AI, Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), and Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) will emerge from a collaborative approach that deeply integrates principles from **embodied cognition**.

My academic journey from **Molecular Biology** to **Cognitive Science** has given me a multi-scale perspective to tackle these challenges. I use **physiological computing** (EEG, fNIRS, etc.) and open-source Python toolboxes as my primary methods to explore the dynamics of conscious experience.

For me, developing responsible technology is not just a technical challenge, but an **ethical imperative**. An embodied, physiological perspective is crucial for creating systems that are not only effective but also transparent, fair, and respectful of human autonomy.

## Research Focus

**Artificial Consciousness** — Computational and biological foundations  
**Brain-Computer Interfaces** — Neural signal processing and interaction  
**Human-Machine Interaction** — Intuitive, adaptive interfaces  
**Physiological Computing** — Biological signals for adaptive systems  
**Embodied Cognition** — Body-environment integration
